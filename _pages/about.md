Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Harvard, advised by [Flavio du Pin Calmon](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/). I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and I interned at [Meta](https://about.meta.com). I am **looking for an internship for Summer 24'** (open to opportunities in the US, Europe, and Singapore)! 

My research interest lies in **Responsible Machine Learning**, which includes fairness, privacy, and interpretability. I contemplate the impacts of ML algorithms on various domains of society for different (exponentially-many) groups of people. I'm currently working on Algorithmic Fairness using tools and frameworks from Information Theory. Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss!

Fairness interventions in machine learning optimized solely for group fairness and accuracy can exacerbate predictive multiplicity. A third axis of ``arbitrariness'' should be considered when deploying models to aid decision-making in applications of individual-level impact.

It is impossible to reliably verify that a personalized classifier with $k \geq 19$ binary group attributes will benefit every group that provides personal data using a dataset of $n = 8 × 10^9$ samples – one for each person in the world.

# Misc
Outside of work, being a pianist and dancer, I have a deep appreciation for all art forms, esp. classical music and ballet/contemporary dance. Growing up as a swimmer, I enjoy sports. From completing a half-marathon and recovering from an ACL injury, for better or worse, I do have many stories to tell. Of course, I love cooking Chinese/Singaporean food and reading away (AntiFragile is my recent favorite!) in the comfort of home!
