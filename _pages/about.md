Hello! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Harvard, advised by [Flavio du Pin Calmon](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/). My expected graduation date is May 2026! I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and I interned at [Citadel LLC](https://www.citadel.com) and [Meta](https://about.meta.com). 

My research interest lies in **Responsible and Trustworthy Machine Learning**, and my work spans LLM watermarking (**ongoing work!**), algorithmic fairness, multiplicity, and more. I contemplate the impacts of ML algorithms on various domains of society for different (exponentially-many) groups of people. I use tools and frameworks from Information Theory, Probability, and Statistics. 
I am always open for collaborations and can be reached via email!

# Publications 
- Kernel Multiaccuracy\
**Carol Xuan Long**, Wael Alghamdi, Alexander Glynn, Yixuan Wu, Flavio P Calmon\
Under Review, 2024.

- [Predictive Churn with the Set of Good Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07745)\
Jamelle Watson-Daniels, Flavio P Calmon, Alexander D’Amour, **Carol Xuan Long**, David C. Parkes, Berk Ustun\ 
Under Review, 2024.\
*TL/DR:* We study the effect of predictive churn - flip in predictions over ML model updates - through the lens of predictive multiplicity – i.e., the prevalence of conflicting predictions over the set of near-optimal models (the ε-Rashomon set). 

- [Multi-Group Proportional Representation in Retrieval](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BRZYhVHvSg)\
Alex Osterling, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, **Carol Xuan Long**, Alexander Glynn, Lucas Monteiro Paes, Sajani Vithana, Martina Cardone, Flavio P Calmon\
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (**NeurIPS**), 2024.\
*TL/DR:* We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We propose practical methods and algorithms for estimating and ensuring MPR in image retrieval, with minimal compromise in retrieval accuracy. 

- [Individual Arbitrariness and Group Fairness](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nzkWhoXUpv)\
**Carol Xuan Long**, Hsiang Hsu, Wael Alghamdi, Flavio P Calmon\
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (**NeurIPS**), 2023, <span style="color:red">**Spotlight Paper**</span>.\
*TL/DR:* Fairness interventions in machine learning optimized solely for group fairness and accuracy can exacerbate predictive multiplicity. A third axis of ``arbitrariness'' should be considered when deploying models to aid decision-making in applications of individual-level impact.

*TL/DR:* It is impossible to reliably verify that a personalized classifier with $k \geq 19$ binary group attributes will benefit every group that provides personal data using a dataset of $n = 8 × 10^9$ samples – one for each person in the world.

# Misc
Outside of work, being a pianist and dancer, I have a deep appreciation for all art forms, esp. classical music and ballet/contemporary dance. Growing up as a swimmer, I enjoy sports. From completing a half-marathon and recovering from an ACL injury, for better or worse, I do have many stories to tell. Of course, I love cooking Chinese/Singaporean food and reading away (AntiFragile is my recent favorite!) in the comfort of home!
